# Predict severe complications after stroke

This repository contains code for the prediction of in-hospital mortality and three further severe complications after acute ischemic stroke, i.e., intracranial mass effect, secondary intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH) and deep vein thrombosis(DVT). The details on the algorithms used, as well as the development and validation of presented outcome prediction models are presented in the following publication: (to be added upon acceptance). 

In addition to the exemplary code that can be used to train models on new data, we share trained models for immediate reuse. 

# Dependencies

Older versions may work, the following ones were employed: 

- python 3.7.1
